 * Section: Module 5
 * Assignment: #5 Calculating Pi (Ï€) using infinite series Program Assignment
 * Due Date: 09/26/2020
 * About this project:  This program asks the user to input a number and then uses
 * it to find PI by calculating using  Gregory-Leibniz Series.
 * Assumptions: The user will follow the steps and will enter characters an not numbers when required.
 * The user wants to input a number for the calculation as soon as the program starts.
 * All work below was performed by CLAUDIO OSORIO */
